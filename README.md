## Projects
### Big Data Pipeline
  - Developed an end-to-end big data pipeline integrating Apache NiFi, HDFS, Hive, and Spark. The pipeline ingested raw data, performed transformations, and enabled real-time querying and analysis, demonstrating scalable data architecture for high-volume data processing.
### Customer Churn Predictive Analysis
  - Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using classification algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest. The project involved EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation to help telecom companies identify at-risk customers and reduce attrition.
### Factors that Influence Exam Scores
  - Analyzed educational data to uncover the most significant factors contributing to high exam performance. Used regression and classification models to predict outcomes based on variables like study time, attendance, sleep, and access to resources.
### Health Impact Predictive Analysis
  - Combined air quality and weather data to forecast potential health risks and hospitalizations. Used time-series and classification models to help health systems prepare for surges during high-risk periods by identifying key environmental triggers.
### Hotel Room Demand  
  - Analyzed hotel booking data to identify seasonal trends, cancellation patterns, and factors influencing booking volume. The project provided insights for optimizing pricing, staffing, and marketing strategies in the hospitality industry.
### Improving Employee Retention Rates  
  - Used HR data to explore patterns behind employee turnover. Built predictive models and visual dashboards to identify key drivers of attrition, aiding organizations in improving retention strategies and workforce satisfaction.
### Real Time Fraud Detection   
  - Developed a real-time fraud detection system using big data tools like Kafka, Spark, and HBase. Implemented classification models to flag suspicious transactions, enhancing security and reducing financial risk for financial institutions.
### Using SQL to Analyze Grammy Award Datasets
  - Leveraged SQL to extract, filter, and analyze Grammy Award data. Identified trends across genres, artists, and nominations, demonstrating proficiency in data querying and aggregation for insightful storytelling.
### Visualizing Childcare Data with Power BI
  - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore childcare availability, affordability, and demographic trends. The visualizations helped stakeholders identify gaps in service and make informed policy decisions.
### Weather API
  - Built a Python-based tool to retrieve and analyze real-time weather data from an external API. Incorporated data cleaning and visualization to support practical applications such as travel planning, event management, or public health monitoring.
